# Object-Oriented-Solar-System-Simulation
This python-based project was developed for an Object Oriented Programming (MATH 240) course at SUNY Geneseo (Spring 2023).  This project animates user specified satellites and rocketsâ€™ flight paths within solar system instances. A designated rocket triggers the generation of a new, unique solar system upon exiting its original solar system.

CODE IS COMING SOON
